  "The Bulk API is built atop Crawlbot, and allows you to submit 
   a large number of URLs for asynchronous processing by a Diffbot API.

   token - your diffbot API token.
   name - Job name. This should be a unique identifier 
          and will be used to modify your bulk job and retrieve its output.
   urls - list of URLs to process.
   api-url - the full Diffbot API to be used for each URL. 
             For instance, to process each URL via the article API, 
             supply http://api.diffbot.com/v2/article. 
             You may also include API parameters, 
             e.g. http://api.diffbot.com/v2/article?fields=meta,tags.
   notify-email - send a message to this email address when the bulk job completes.
   notify-webhook - pass a URL to be notified when the bulk job completes. 
                    You will receive a POST with the full JSON response in the POST body.
   repeat - specify the number of days as a floating-point (e.g. :repeat 7.0) to 
            repeat this job. By default bulk jobs will not be repeated.
   max-rounds - specify the maximum number of repeats. Use :max-rounds -1 to continually repeat.
   page-process-pattern - list of patterns to limit pages processed to those 
                          whose HTML contains any of the content strings. 
                          If a page does not contain at least one of the strings, it will be ignored."
